# Time Display

Here you'll find my second Coding Dojo Django assignment, creating a web page
that displays the current time and date. The goal of the assignment is to
render an HTML file and link to a CSS file using Django

If you go to localhost:8000 while running the django server you will see
the current time and date taken from the moment you loaded the page. It has been
styled in a minimal, basic way simply to demonstrate the connection between the
CSS file and the HTML page being rendered.
